# Intervene #

**An interactive Shiny App for UpSet plots, Venn diagrams and Pairwise heatmaps**

Intervene Shiny App provides an interactive interface for intersection and effective visualization of gene or genomic region sets. Currently, Shiny app does not acccept genomic regions as input, but the text files generated by Interve's [command line interface](https://github.com/asntech/intervene) can be easily uploaded to further explore and customize the plots in an interactive way. Intervene has three modules:

* **venn** to generate Venn diagrams of up-to 6 sets,
* **upset** to generate UpSet plots of more than 3 sets and 
* **pairwise** to compute and visualize pariwise intersections as clustered heatmap.
