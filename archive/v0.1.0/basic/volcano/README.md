## [Volcano](/basic/volcano)

- Introduction

  The volcanogram is a visual representation of the difference in gene expression between two samples.

- Analysis of case data

  The loaded data is the gene name and its corresponding logFC and p.value.

- Interpretation of case statistics graphics

  The horizontal axis is denoted by log2 (fold change), and the more different genes are distributed at both ends of the picture.The ordinate is denoted by -log10 (p.value) and is the negative log of the P value of T test significance.Blue dots represent down-regulated genes, red dots represent up-regulated genes, and gray dots represent genes that are not significantly different.
