## [Line Regression](/basic/line-regression)

- Introduction

  Linear regression is a regression method for linear modeling of the relationship between independent variables and dependent variables.If there is only one independent variable, it is called simple regression, and if there is more than one independent variable, it is called multiple regression.

- Analysis of case data

  The loaded data are independent variables, dependent variables and groups.

- Interpretation of case statistics graphics

  Different colors represent different groups, and linear regression equations can be added. The closer R squared is to 1, the closer the fitted curve is to the actual curve.
