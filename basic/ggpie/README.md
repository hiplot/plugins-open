- Interpretation of case statistics graphics

  In a circle graph, the arc length of each slice (the arc length of its center Angle and the region corresponding to its center Angle) is proportional to the number represented. The pie chart shows the number of samples for the 1 to 4 components and the corresponding proportions. The number of samples in one group is 13, accounting for 11.71%; the number of samples in two groups is 34, accounting for 30.63%; the number of samples in three groups is 21, accounting for 18.92%; and the number of samples in four groups is 43, accounting for 38.74%.
