# [Deviation plot](/basic/deviation-plot)

Introduction

Deviation plot provides a visual representation of the differences between data points.

- Case Study Data Analysis

  The case study data is from the `mtcars` dataset, where the key is `name` (car model) and the value is `mpg` (miles per gallon) for plotting.

- Interpretation of Case Study Statistical Graph

  Compute the `z-score` for `mpg`, sort the values, and categorize them based on the boundary of 0. The left side represents the low-efficiency group, while the right side represents the high-efficiency group.

- Special Parameters

  sort_method: Specify whether to sort in ascending or descending order.
