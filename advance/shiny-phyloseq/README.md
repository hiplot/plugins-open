## Launching Shiny-phyloseq Local Session

While it is possible to host the server "back end" somewhere
so that users only need to point their web browser to a link,
it is also possible to launch both the back and front "ends" on your local machine.
The server back end will be an R session on your own machine,
while the front end is your web browser,
pointed to the appropriate local URL.

### [Quick install/launch instructions](http://joey711.github.io/shiny-phyloseq/Install.html)

Simply [launching Shiny-phyloseq](http://joey711.github.io/shiny-phyloseq/Install.html)
should also install missing/old packages.
Make sure that you first have installed
[the latest version of R](http://cran.r-project.org/).

The following R code will launch Shiny-phyloseq on most systems.


```r
install.packages("shiny") 
shiny::runGitHub("shiny-phyloseq","joey711")
```

See the 
[Shiny-phyloseq installation instructions](http://joey711.github.io/shiny-phyloseq/Install.html),
for further details.
