## [Seqlogo](/basic/ggseqlogo)

- Introduction

  The sequence LOGO is a graphic that describes a sequence pattern of binding sites.

- Analysis of case data

  The loaded data is the Sequence of binding sites for multiple transcription factors on multiple genes.

- Interpretation of case statistics graphics

  A sequence of binding sites was displayed in a column of the chart by means of BITS calculation, which could clearly observe the large proportion of bases of different sequences.

- Extra parameters

  Seqtype: DNA represents DNA sequence, RNA represents RNA sequence, aa represents amino acid sequence.

  Color Scheme: Different colors of base 

  Method: BITS represented the proportion of different bases in the vertical coordinate axis with the maximum value of 2 by using the BIT formula;Prob represents the proportion of bases in the total base of the sequence, which is displayed in the vertical axis with the maximum value of 1..
