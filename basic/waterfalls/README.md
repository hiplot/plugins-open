## [Waterfalls](https://hiplot-academic.com/basic/waterfalls)

- Introduction

  The waterfall chart is used to display the cumulative effect of sequentially introduced positive or negative values .  These intermediate values can either be time based or category based. 

- Analysis of case data

  The loaded data have two columns, with the first for category based items and the second for their corresponding values.

- Interpretation of case statistics graphics

  As shown in the example figure, the x-axis represent each category based items, the y-axis showing their cumulative values.  Increments and decrements that are sufficiently extreme can cause the cumulative total to fall above and below the axis at various points. 

- Extra Parameters

  Rect Text Size: set the size of the text in the rectangles.

  Bar Width: set the width of the rectangle bar.

  Line Type: set the the linetype drawn between successive rectangles.
