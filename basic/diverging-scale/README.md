## [Diverging scale](/basic/diverging-scale)

- Introduction

  The diverging scale is a graph that maps a continuous, quantitative input to a continuous fixed interpolator.

- Analysis of case data

  The first column is a list of model names, and the remaining columns enter the relevant indicators and corresponding values.

- Interpretation of case statistics graphics

  Hp data is shown on the horizontal axis, model names (classification) are shown on the vertical axis, models above average are shown in red, and models below average are shown in blue. Data is assigned on a scale of 2 by size.

- Extra parameters

  Type: Lollipop represents the drawing of sliding beads on both sides of the central axis;Bar represents a bar graph drawn on both sides of the central axis.

  Scale: When scale is turned on, the data is normalized and displayed on a scale of Â±2; when scale is turned off, the vertical slide ball chart and histogram are displayed.

  Line size: As the right pull value increases, the red and blue lines extending from the vertical axis become thicker.

  Point size: As the value of the right pull increases, the point of the horizontal and vertical values at the end of the red and blue lines becomes larger.

  Color: indicates the line color, the default red is the positive line color, and blue is the negative line color.
