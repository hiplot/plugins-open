## [Upset](/basic/upset-plot)

- Data table

   There are two types of data tables: list and binary. The list format is that each column is a set and contains all the elements corresponding to the set. In the binary format, the first column is all the elements of all sets, and the subsequent columns are a numeric matrix composed of 0 and 1. 1 indicates that the corresponding row element exists in a certain set, and 0 indicates that it does not exist.
