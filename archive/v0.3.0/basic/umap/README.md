## [UMAP](/basic/umap)

- Introduction

  UMAP is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithm suitable for high-dimensional data reduction to two or three dimensions and visualization. The algorithm can make the t distribution of points with greater similarity closer in the lower dimensional space. For low similarity points, the t distribution is farther away in the low dimensional space.

- Analysis of case data

  The loaded data are the data set (gene name and corresponding gene expression value) and sample information (sample name and grouping)

- Interpretation of case statistics graphics

  Different colors represent different samples, which is the same as PCA (principal component analysis) graphic interpretation. The difference lies in the visualization effect. For dissimilar points in T-SNE, a small distance will generate a large gradient to repel them.
