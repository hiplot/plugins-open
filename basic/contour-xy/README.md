## [Contour (XY)](/basic/contour-xy)

- Introduction

  Contour plot (XY) is a data processing method that reflects data density through contour line.

- Analysis of case data

  The loaded data are two variables.

- Interpretation of case statistics graphics

  Just as contour lines in geography represent different heights, different contour lines in contour maps represent different densities. The closer to the center, the smaller contour loop is, and the higher the regional data density is. For example, the data density of yellow area is the highest, while that of blue area is the lowest.
