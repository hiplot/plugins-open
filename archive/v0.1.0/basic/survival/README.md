## [Survival Analysis](/basic/survival)

- Introduction

  The survivorship curve is a graph showing the number or proportion of individuals surviving to each age for a given species or group (e.g. males or females). 

- Analysis of case data

  The loaded data are point-in-time, status and groups.

- Interpretation of case statistics graphics

  The horizontal axis represents the time axis and the vertical axis represents the probability of survival.The red curve represents the survivolship curve of G1 group and the blue curve represents the survivolship curve of G2 group.After logrank test, p value =0.0013<0.05 indicated that the difference in survival status between the two groups could not be explained by sampling error, and the grouping factor was the reason for the difference in survival rate between the two curves.The graph shows that overall survival is better in G2 than in G1.
