## [Gradient Barplot](/basic/barplot-gradient)

- Introduction

   It is similar to the bubble chart, but on the basis of the histogram, a color gradient rectangle is used to simultaneously display the visualization of two variables.

- Case data analysis

   The first column is Go Term (Go language code), the second column is the number of genes, and the third column is pvalue.

- Graphic interpretation of case statistics

   As shown in the figure, blue is a low pvalue color, and red is a high pvalue color. As the pvalue increases, the color changes from blue to red. The abscissa indicates the number of genes.

- Extra parameters

   Number of impressions: show the number of Go IDs in Go Term

   Horizontal: When it is turned on, the ordinate is Go id, the abscissa is a value, and the graph is a rectangle arranged horizontally. When it is closed, the horizontal and vertical coordinates are reversed, and the graph is a rectangle arranged vertically.

   Low value color: indicates the color displayed by low pvalue

   High value color: indicates the color displayed by high pvalue
