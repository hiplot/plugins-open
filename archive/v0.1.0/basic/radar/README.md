## [Radar](/basic/radar)

- Introduction

  Radar chart displays multivariable data in the form of two-dimensional charts representing three or more quantitative variables on the axis starting from the same point, so as to visually express the comparison of a research object in multiple parameters.

- Analysis of case data

  The loaded data is data set (expression levels of 5 genes in 4 diseases).

- Interpretation of case statistics graphics

  Each color of the radar map represents a disease, and the position of each point represents different gene expression. The higher the gene expression value, the farther away it is from the center of the circle, and vice versa.
