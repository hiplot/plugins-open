## [Gene Density](https://hiplot.com.cn/basic/gene-density)

- Introduction

  The gene density is used to display the distribution of gene density among different chromosomes with the colored heat map and area graph.

- Analysis of case data

  The loaded data have two files, the first file contain the chromosome information with three columns: chr, start, end, the second file contain the gene information with three columns: chr, start, end.

- Interpretation of case statistics graphics

  As shown in the example figure,  gene density across every chromosomes are displayed with colored heat map and combined area graph.

- Extra Parameters

  Windows:  set the window size to calculate genomic density.
