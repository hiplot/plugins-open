## [Barplot Color Group](/basic/barplot-color-group)

The color group barplot can be used to display data values in groups, and to label different colors in sequence, which is often used to visualize the results of GO/KEGG pathway enrichment analysis.

- Data table (three columns):

   Term | Entry name, such as GO/KEGG channel name

   Count | The numerical size of the entry, such as the number of genes enriched in a pathway

   Type | Category to which this channel belongs: such as BP/MF/CC/KEGG

- Extra parameters:

   Display number | Used to control the maximum number of entries displayed in each group in the histogram. If set to 4, only the first 4 records of each group in Type will be taken
