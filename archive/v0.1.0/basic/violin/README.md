## [Violin](/basic/violin)

- Introduction

  The violin plot, named for its resemblance to a violin, is a statistical diagram combining a box diagram with a kernel density diagram to show the distribution of data and the probability density.

- Analysis of case data

  The loaded data is data set (gene names and expression levels in different tumors).

- Interpretation of case statistics graphics

  The violin plot can reflect the data distribution, which is similar to the box diagram. The black horizontal line in the box shows the median gene expression level in each tumor, and the upper and lower edges in the white box represent the upper and lower quartiles in the data set. The violin graph can also reflect the data density, and the more concentrated the data set, the fatter the graph. The gene expression distribution in the BLGG group is more concentrated, followed by BIC group and AML group.

- Extra parameters

  P Value Form:Value is a numeric value, signif is the number of "\*" and no is not showing the P value

  Add Boxplot:Place a boxplot inside the violin
