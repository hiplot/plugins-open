## [Gene Ranking Dotplot](https://hiplot.com.cn/basic/gene-rank)

- Introduction

  The gene ranking dotplot is used to display the differentially expressed genes with sorted ranking by the log2foldchange and pvalues with colored dot chart. 

- Analysis of case data

  The loaded data have three columns, with the first represent gene names, the second for log2FC and the third for pvalues.

- Interpretation of case statistics graphics

  As shown in the example figure, the x-axis represents the ranking of every differentially expressed genes, the y-axis shows the log2foldchange, the dot is colored by the pvalues and the dot size represents the log2foldchange.

- Extra Parameters

  log2FC: set the threshold of log2foldchage, default is 1.

  TopN: set the number of labeled top genes.

  Label Size: set the font size of labels.
