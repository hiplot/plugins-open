## [Network (igraph)](/basic/network-igraph)

- Introduction

  Network (igraph) can be used to visulize basic network based on igraph.

- Data Table

   Two data tables need to be entered. Table 1 is node information, including node ID and other annotation information, which can be used to map color and size. Table 2 is the link information, including node ID and connection information between nodes

- Data args

   Label Column: used to label node names

   Color Column: used to map node and connection colors

   Node Size Column: used to map node size. If not set, the degrees (#links) of nodes will be used

   Mark Group Column: convert the selected types of nodes by using irregular color graphics

   Line Width Column: used to map the line width

- Extra parameters

   Layout: set the distribution style of the nodes and lines of the network diagram

   Line Type: set type of lines

   Node Shape: set shape of nodes

   Transform (size): used to scale and transform node size column data

   Transform (width): used to scale and transform the line width column data

   Label Distance: control the distance between label and graph
