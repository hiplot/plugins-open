## [Dendrogram](/basic/dendrogram)

- Introduction

  The dendrogram is a diagram representing a tree. This diagrammatic representation is frequently used in different contexts:In hierarchical clustering, it illustrates the arrangement of the clusters produced by the corresponding analyses.

  In computational biology, it shows the clustering of genes or samples, sometimes in the margins of heatmaps. 

- Analysis of case data

  The loaded data are gene name and corresponding gene expression value.

- Interpretation of case statistics graphics

  The figure is like a tree perpendicular to 90Â°. M1-M10 represents the root, and the branches grow and converge to the right to form the trunk of the branch.It can be seen that the figure generates 2 classes, 4 classes, and so on.

- Extra Parameters

  Clade:

  Distance Measure:

  Type of tree:Change the shape of the tree

  Add Lable Color:After clustering, samples with similar names and colors are similar
