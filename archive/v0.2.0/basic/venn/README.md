## [Venn](/basic/venn)

- Introduction

  A Venn diagram is a diagramthat shows all possible logical relations between a finite collection of different sets. These diagrams depict elements as points in the plane, and sets as regions inside closed curves. A Venn diagram consists of multiple overlapping closed curves, usually circles, each representing a set. The points inside a curve labelled S represent elements of the set S, while points outside the boundary represent elements not in the set S. This lends to easily read visualizations; for example, the set of all elements that are members of both sets Sand T, S âˆ© T, is represented visually by the area of overlap of the regions S and T. In Venn diagrams the curves are overlapped in every possible way, showing all possible relations between the sets. 

- Analysis of case data

  The loaded data is a collection of five gene names.

- Interpretation of case statistics graphics

  The closed curve of 5 colors represents 5 sets, and the number represents the number of overlapping or non-overlapping genes in multiple sets. For example, 8 in the sample figure represents 8 identical gene names in 5 sample sets.
