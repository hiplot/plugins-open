## [Dual Y Axis Chart](/basic/dual-y-axis)

- Introduction

The dual Y-axis graph can put two groups of data with larger orders of magnitude in the same graph for display.

- Analysis of case data

The loaded data is divided into three columns, the first column is the value of the x-axis, the second column is the value of the left Y-axis, and the third column is the value of the right Y-axis.

- Interpretation of case statistics graphics

In the case data, the Y-axis scale on the left is in the range of 0-100, while the Y-axis scale on the right is 0-1000.

- Extra Parameters

Coefficient: used for scaling of the second Y-axis scale

Color1: The color of the first polyline

Color2: The second discounted color
