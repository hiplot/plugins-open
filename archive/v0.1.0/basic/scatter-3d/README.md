## [3D Scatter](/basic/scatter-3d)

- Introduction

  3D scatter plot is to apply a number of quantitative variables to different coaxes in space and combine different variables into coordinates in space, so as to clearly explain the interaction between the three quantitative variables.

- Analysis of case data

  The loaded data are three variables and grouping.

- Interpretation of case statistics graphics

  In the figure, temperature, pressure and time are respectively placed on x (horizontal axis), Y (vertical axis) and Z (perspective axis) to generate a THREE-DIMENSIONAL scatter plot, and the correlation between variables and their correlation degree can be intuitively found.

- Extra parameters

  Phi:The larger the positive value is, the more it tends to observe from the top down. The greater the negative value, the more likely it is to be observed from the bottom of the three-dimensional figure upwards.

  Theta:The Angle at which a three-dimensional figure rotates horizontally
