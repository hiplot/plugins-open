## [3D Barplot](/basic/barplot-3d)

- Introduction

  3D bar charts are used to provide a 3D look and feel for the data. The third dimension is often used for aesthetic reasons, but it does not improve data reading. Still intended to show comparisons between discrete categories.

- Analysis of case data

  The loaded data are efficacy data of different doses of drugs in different treatment regimens.

- Interpretation of case statistics graphics

  The 3D histogram shows the different therapeutic effects of different treatment groups (groups 1 to 4) with low, medium and high doses. Group 1 had the best effect with medium dose treatment, group 2 had the best effect with high dose treatment, group 3 had no significant difference with dose treatment, and group 4 had the best effect with high dose treatment.

- Extra Parameters

  Phi:The larger the positive value is, the more it tends to observe from the top down. The greater the negative value, the more likely it is to be observed from the bottom of the three-dimensional figure upwards.

  Theta:The Angle at which a three-dimensional figure rotates horizontally.
