## [Scatter](/basic/scatter)

- Introduction

   Two groups of data are used to form multiple coordinate points. By observing the distribution of coordinate points, it can judge whether there is correlation between variables or summarize the data processing mode of coordinate point distribution.

- Analysis of case data

  The loaded data are the horizontal axis values and their corresponding vertical axis values and groups.

- Interpretation of case statistics graphics

  Value1 represents the horizontal axis and Value2 represents the vertical axis. The diagram shows that Value1 and Value2 in treatment plan 1 are positively correlated: that is, when Value1 becomes larger, Value2 will become larger; In treatment plan 2, two variables are negatively correlated: that is, when Value1 becomes larger, Value2 becomes smaller.

- Extra parameters

  Change Point Shape:Different groups have different shapes.
