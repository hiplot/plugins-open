# [Interval Area Plot](/basic/interval-area-chart)

- Case Data Analysis

  The case data consists of the highest and lowest temperatures for each of the twelve months in a year, along with the corresponding abbreviated month names.

  Based on the case data, temperature intervals and average temperature lines have been plotted for each month.
