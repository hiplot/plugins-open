## [HiC Heatmap](https://hiplot-academic.com/basic/hic-heatmap)

- Introduction

  The HiC heatmap is used to display the genome-wide chromatin interaction with heatmap on different chromosomes.

- Analysis of case data

  The loaded data have three columns, with the first for one locus bin index, the second for another locus bin index, and the third for the interaction frequency between this two locus.

- Interpretation of case statistics graphics

  As shown in the example figure,  a heat map represent the  interaction frequency between any two locus. The color displays their intensity of interaction.

- Extra Parameters

  Resolution:  set the resolution of calculated interaction frequency.

  Interval: set the tick interval of x and y-axis.
