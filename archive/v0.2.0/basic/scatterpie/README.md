## [Scatter Pie](/basic/scatterpie)

Scatter Pie can be used to visualize data fraction in different space coordinates.

Currently, this plugin provides a simple API for the Scatter Pie implementation in [scatterpie](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/scatterpie/vignettes/scatterpie.html) package.

The input data table should contains at least 3 columns. The first two columns correspond to the space coordinates and other more columns represents data values in different categories. If you know the long/wide data format, you can also provide input data table with long format (default is wide format).
