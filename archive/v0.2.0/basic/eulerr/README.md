- Introduction

   The proportional Venn diagram is a Venn diagram that can display the relationship between sets in proportion.

- Case data analysis

   The first column represents different variables and the intersection relationship between variables. The intersection relationship is connected with the "&" symbol, and the second column indicates the value of the single variable or the intersection between variables.

- Case graphic analysis

   Consistent with the Venn diagram, the area of the single variable or the intersection area of the variable is proportional to its value.
