## [PCA](/basic/pca)

- Introduction

  Principal component analysis (PCA) is a data processing method with "dimension reduction" as the core, replacing multi-index data with a few comprehensive indicators (PCA), and restoring the most essential characteristics of data.

- Analysis of case data

  The loaded data are set (gene name and corresponding gene expression value) and sample information (sample name and grouping).

- Interpretation of case statistics graphics

  Different colors represent different samples, which can explain the relationship between principal components and original variables. For example, M1 has a greater contribution to PC1, while M8 has a greater negative correlation with PC1.
